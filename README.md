# Automated-Fan-Arduino-Repository-
This repository contains the code that was utilized upon an Arduino Duo to power and operate a fan apparatus. 
The fan blades were made from balsa wood and attached to a TT yellow gear motor. This was wired to a breadboard which was wired to an Arduino Duo.
The Breadboard consisted of a transistor, HC-SR04 sensor, resistors and a diode. 
The code in this repository is C++ based and was pushed to the Arduino Duo. This code regulated the input from the motion sensor and would trigger the fan when need be. 

Below is a link to provide further understanding about Arduino Code.
